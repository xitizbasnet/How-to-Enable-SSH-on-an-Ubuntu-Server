# How to Enable SSH on an Ubuntu Server

This guide explains how to enable SSH on an Ubuntu server. SSH allows secure remote access to your server, and this document will walk you through the necessary steps to install and configure OpenSSH on Ubuntu.

## Prerequisites

- An Ubuntu server
- A user with `sudo` privileges

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Update Package Lists and Install OpenSSH Server

First, open a terminal and update the package lists for your system:



```bash
sudo apt update
```

Next, install the OpenSSH server package:

```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

### 2. Enable and Start the SSH Service

To ensure that the SSH service starts automatically on boot, use the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

Start the SSH service with the command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

Check the status of the SSH service to ensure it's running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see an active (running) status for the SSH service.

### 3. Configure Firewall (if applicable)

If your system uses a firewall, such as UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall), you need to allow SSH connections. Run the following command to allow SSH traffic through the firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
```

If you're using a different firewall solution, make sure to allow traffic on port 22 (the default SSH port).

### 4. (Optional) Configure SSH

You can customize the SSH configuration file to modify settings like the port number, allowed users, and authentication methods. Before making any changes, it's a good idea to create a backup of the original configuration file:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.bak
```

Open the configuration file using a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Make the desired changes (such as changing the port, disabling password authentication, etc.), then save and close the file.

Finally, restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### 5. Test the SSH Connection

To verify that SSH is working correctly, you can attempt to connect to your Ubuntu server from another machine:

```bash
ssh username@server_ip_address
```

Replace `username` with your Ubuntu username and `server_ip_address` with the IP address of your Ubuntu server.

If the connection is successful, you should be logged into your server remotely.

## Troubleshooting

- **SSH Service Not Running**: If you can't connect, check if the SSH service is running by using `sudo systemctl status ssh` and make sure it's active.
- **Firewall Issues**: If you have trouble connecting, ensure your firewall allows SSH connections. Use `sudo ufw allow ssh` or ensure port 22 is open.
- **Permission Denied**: If you encounter a "Permission denied" error, ensure youâ€™re using the correct username and password or check your SSH keys if you're using key-based authentication.
